To include the CSS file from the RawGit CDN link, use the following HTML.

{% highlight html %}
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/resir014/Clear-Sans-Webfont/v1.0.0/css/clear-sans.css">
{% endhighlight %}

**Heads up:** This particular file is hosted on RawGit's CDN, which is a free service, so there are no uptime or support guarantees. It is highly preferred that you manually host the files yourself.
